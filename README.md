# chastetris
An very chaste(pure) version of Tetris using the Raylib library and C programming language.

Because I love playing Tetris, I used all my programming skills to make a simple game that I can play with a few features that I wish other Tetris games had.
There is infinite time to place the blocks because there is no gravity.
Additionally, you can press the '.' key to save the game at any time and then press ',' to reload to the previously saved state.
This means my game is the only Tetris game that lets you go back in time to fix mistakes!
