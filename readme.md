Chaste Tris License

I have decided to release Chaste Tris under the [GPL3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) license. My reasoning for this is as follows.

When I made my Tetris game, Chaste Tris, it was a programming experiment to push the limits of what I can do. All code is my original code with the exception of SDL version 2 which powers graphics and input handling in the SDL version.

In the early days, I also had prototyped it with Raylib and Allegro to get a feel for those libraries. I have determined SDL to be the most reliable library for my simple goals for this game.

I wish to license users of this game to play and learn the mechanics of how it works and to be able to modify it provided they have the technical knowledge to be able to do it. This will include the ability to access the source code which will be provided on my github repository.

I want to encourage development of similar games by other programmers because it is a great way to learn the fundamentals of computer programming and all that goes into it. I want to have open communication from those who enjoy playing it and/or have improvements that they can make or that I can possibly implement.

By releasing this game under the GNU General Public License. I am also making the statement that nobody, not even the Tetris Company has the right to restrict who can play Tetris and in what forms. I also believe that my game does something unique by removing the gravity so that users have infinite time to place the blocks for a relaxing experience that cannot be obtained in officially licensed Tetris games.

I have purchased every modern Tetris game available to me for PC and Nintendo Switch. I support the work of Alexey Pajitnov and developers at these companies who deserve to be paid, but Tetris must also be available to anyone, including autistic children running Linux on old computers who have no job, no money, and a mother who doesn't know anything about computers (yes, this is oddly specific because I was once that child).

This game is my free gift to the world. You can compile the source from the Github (ask me if you need help) or you can play the Steam edition for free.

Chaste Tris Music License

The only thing in Chaste Tris that is not my creation is the music which was obtained freely from OverClocked ReMix.

According to my understanding of the terms in the FAQ I am allowed to use the songs as long as I give credit to OC Remix and the artists. As such, I intend to mention them in every video I create showing the gameplay with the newly added music. In fact, if I have not included credit anywhere it is most likely a technical limitation such as Tiktok or Instagram not allowing me to add long descriptions. But where possible I will give credit to the artists and OC ReMix.

Both of these songs are remixes of the songs originally included in Gameboy Tetris. They are as follows.

OverClocked ReMix

ReMix:Tetris "Gift from Moscow"
By MkVaff

ReMix:Tetris "T-Spin"
By Schtiffles

https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR04112

These two songs were chosen precisely because they fit in with the dream I had for the game considering that it is a Tetris game, and the Gameboy version was probably the most popular version of all time and the only one many people were even exposed to in the 80s.

As a third addition, I have selected another arrangement by MkVaff because it's fast dance nature feels amazing even though it is from a game known as Chrono Trigger for SNES I played years ago.

ReMix:Chrono Trigger "Protector in Green"

I have also considered including a remix of Dance of the Sugarplum Fairy if I can find one that sounds good that I can use with permission. If you know of one, please let me know.
