These are my notes on compiling programs written with Allegro5 on Windows

First I needed to download a binary release for Windows.

https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5/releases

The file I downloaded was:

allegro-x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc-12.1.0-posix-seh-static-5.2.8.0.zip

That's because I need it to work on a 64 bit CPU and statically linked to avoid DLL hell on Windows. My first attempts at compiling through msys2 did not go well.

Then what I did was copy the extracted files into my existing w64devkit that I have already been using to compile my SDL programs on Windows. It worked well enough for SDL.

I merged them into the root w64devkit folder.

I then rewrote my SDL compiling script to point to different paths and linker commands.

It looks like this:

---

SET DEVKIT=C:\w64devkit
SET COMPILER_PATH=%DEVKIT%\bin
SET PATH=%COMPILER_PATH%;

gcc -Wall -ansi -pedantic main.c -o main -I%DEVKIT%\include -L%DEVKIT%\lib -lallegro -lallegro_primitives -lallegro_image && main

---

I wasn't able to figure out the actual static linking so it did require 3 DLL files to be present with the executable to run. However I am satisfied and can always learn more about how to static link with Allegro later.
