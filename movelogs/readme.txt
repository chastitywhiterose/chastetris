One of the unique features of my game is the ability to run commands from a file instead of the keyboard. This works because the blocks are in a fixed order and not random. Same input means same result. The game will read from a file named imovelog.txt and write to one named omovelog.txt
You need only to rename the files you want to keep and save them for later use. This functions just like the Nullpomino replay feature.
