LST stacking is very score efficient in Tetris but also brutally hard to pull off. There is no real pattern to rely on like there is in ST Stacking.

There also are not very many resources on LST stacking by comparison to other openings or playing styles. At the time of this writing, the Hard Drop wiki lacks a page on LST stacking.

As part of the post, this video was included which inspired me to make a serious attempt at LST stacking.

Because the goal is to be able to do LST stacking using my own game Chaste Tris, I needed a special opening which is possible even with an early T piece. In my game the order of every bag is always ITZJOLS. Because of this, some of the TKI openings simply don't work. However, a reversed form of TKI Flat Top does work! I have been studying it because it seems some variation of TKI opening is always used to start LST stacking.

My goal is the highest possible score. This means that I need every single T block to be able to achieve a T Spin Double.
